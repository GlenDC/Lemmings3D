##Lemmings3D

This is my final programming project for my education at HOWEST, Belgium.
The goal was to create a game with C++11, Directx10 and the Nvidia PhysicX library.
The code you see here is for those who are interested in the code, after seeing/testing the game.
Questions can be asked [via mail](mailto:contact@glendc.com).

## Remark
A lot of files are not in the public repository. This was a project for HOWEST Belgium. 
This game is build on top of a framework, written by professors of mine. I do not have the rights to upload my edited version of this framework. That's why I ignored this folder, together with the PugiXML Library Folder.
